## DISCLAIMER
>First of all I think it's important to make it clear that, although Café >Westen is an actual bar/restaurant, I have *not* been asked to, nor >comissioned to, make this website. This was all on my initiative with the >purpose to learn and improve as a developer. I just wanted to use a real >existing website to remake as a project. It's a really cool place, though, >so if you ever find yourself in Leipzig, Germany, make sure you pay [Cafè Westen](https://www.cafe-westen.de/) a visit.

## THE PROJECT
### Motivation
I wanted to create a small static site that is fast and light so I wanted to rely mainly on **HTML** and **CSS**. I decided to explore **Bun** in a more active capacity so I run a tiny static server to serve files as well as running Bun as the main bundler and runtime.

For interactivity and client related functionality I decided to go with **AlpineJS** since its only job is toggling accordion panels between an open and closed state, providing responsive images, x-cloak to avoid FOUC, and basic accessibility.

The real Café Westen site uses **Quandoo** as a reservation management solution so I wanted to try and implement a similar widget on my version as well. It was not easy. 

Finally, I want to bring some attention to **Rachel Johnson** and her simple and clean website that inspired my decision to use accordions as navigation. Thanks!

## LAYOUT AND DESIGN
In general, I went with an **80's neon light** approach that was a lot of fun to play around with. 

### Fonts
Edges || Geomanist

### Images and videos
Responsive and rendered with lazy-load.
All image editing and logo enhancement done by me using **GIMP**.

## LIGHTHOUSE SCORE
- **Performance:** 90
- **Accessibility:** 100
- **Best practices:** 100
- **SEO:** 91
